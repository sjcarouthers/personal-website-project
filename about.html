            I am currently training to become a software developer, my previous experience with coding includes html, css, and php. I have made a few basic websites and forums before, but Javascript
            adds a whole new world for me.

            I have a family with a wife and 3 kids, I love to explore the outdoors and go camping regularly. My favorite hike leads to a place called Abram's falls (see picture below)
