# personal-website-project
This is my first html website for Fullstack Academy.  It will (hopefully) feature multiple good-looking pages with multimedia, hyperlinks, and an interactive Javascript element.

My main page will feature short snippets about myself, my portfolio, and maybe some interesting things.

My about page will be all the details about myself, including pictures I have taken.

My portfolio page will be the hub of all of my coding-related experiences
